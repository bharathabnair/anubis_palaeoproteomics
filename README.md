![anubis_workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2362fcd5-6fc1-4d53-af54-a869757c65a2)

## Quick start
- Go to anubis_v1 folder and choose to open .ipynb files in Colab
- A Github account will be needed for authorisation. Go to [Github](https://github.com/) and get one if you haven't >_<

## Documentation
- under construction but please see Notebooks' annotations

## FAQs
1. Could I use the BLG model for other proteins? <br> well it is not recommended cos physical-chemical features (atom coordinates) were based on a BLG structure file.
2. Do I need a Google Colab subscription?<br>Anubis is lightweight and a normal CPU runtime is sufficient (with no subscriptions).
3. Do I need a Google account? <br> May make life easier. Colab can also access files in your Google drive (with permission).
4. Help! Still unsure how to use Anubis. <br> Open an issue or get in touch with me ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.15.623824v1))
